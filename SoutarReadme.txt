Andrew,

I’m following up on an offer APL made to you some time ago. We haven’t heard either way from you, and I’ve been told to close the loop. If you’re still interested, we should talk ASAP. If you’re not, we’d appreciate the professional courtesy of a reply so we can rescind the offer officially and consider other candidates.

I hope this finds you safe and healthy!

V/R,
Ben Zintak
